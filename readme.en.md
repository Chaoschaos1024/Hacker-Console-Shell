# Hacker Console Open-Source Project

## Update Notice

June 25, 2026: The enclosure has been updated to accommodate the new power module; the new design offers higher integration and a reduced thickness of 31mm.

## Project Overview
**Hacker Console** is a handheld terminal designed by myself, based on the Raspberry Pi B series as the mainboard.  
If you are interested in my design, please search for **"Hacker Console"** on **Bilibili**.

As a highly expandable handheld terminal, it features:
- **Driver-free HDMI display** with touch support
- Keyboard based on the **HID protocol**, communicating via **USB**, plug-and-play
- Independent keyboard PCB design, replaceable
- Equipped with a **secondary display** for device status information
- **Exposed GPIO headers**
- **Open-source enclosure design**

## Mechanical Parts Version Selection Guide

### 📌 Version Mapping
| Your Device Version | Recommended Mechanical File | Notes |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| **Old Version** (original keyboard + original mainboard) | `HackerConsle结构件-适用于初版键盘和初版主板.3mf` | Compatible with the earliest hardware design |
| **New Version** (improved keyboard + improved mainboard) | `HackerConsole结构件-适用于改进后的键盘以及改进后的主板.3mf` | Includes the latest design optimizations |

### 🔧 Common Hardware Components
> **Important**: Both versions use the **same common hardware components**, including:
> - Various screws
> - Hinge / shaft mechanisms
> - Standard connectors

**Be sure to refer to the bill of materials file**: 📁 `物料清单.csv`

### 🛠️ How to Choose the Correct Version
#### 1. Identify Your Hardware Version
- **Old version characteristics**: keyboard with a protruding black joystick; speaker module implemented as a separate PCB
- **New version characteristics**: small metal joystick; speaker integrated on the new mainboard with metal contacts, no wiring required
